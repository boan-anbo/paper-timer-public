# Why Paper Timer

Paper timer makes your reading and writing more efficient and stress-free.

It's more than a timer to track time; it's a simple and yet powerful tool to let you experiment with methods of reading and writing that suit you and turn them into habits.

See [use cases](#usages) for examples of using Paper Timer for different scenarios.

# Ideas

The design philosophy of Paper Timer holds true three principles about reading and writing. I don't enforce

## Iteration

## Selectivity

Reading are never thorough and complete. With Paper Timer, however, you can turn the negative incompleteness to a positive selectivity: read actively within time limits. Do one thing, e.g. reading for argument, writing answers, reading for answers, writing your own summary, at a time and do it well.

## Spacing

# Terms

Item
: An item to read and write using a certain method.
: E.g., a reading item could be a journal article, or a section of a paper you want to write.
: However, an item in Paper Timer also means _a method or a situation_. Sometimes you want to skim an article, sometimes you want to read thoroughly, and sometimes you are pressed with time but still want to take most our of the article with all the time you have. The **"situation"** is crucial for item.
: To give an concrete example, for an average journal article, say 25-45 pages, there can be three `items` for this kind of journal articles: (1) an item called "Journal article scanning" (which takes 2 `stages` and 5 minutes to read in total), (2) "Journal article close reading" (which takes 6 `stages` and 40 minutes), and (3) "Journal article fast reading (which also takes 6 `stages` but only 25 minutes).

Stage
: A step in an [`item`](#terms). Ideally, should focus on only one task.
: E.g. during the "previewing" `stage`, look only for the central argument; and then during the "reading for evidence" `stage`, try to identify the key evidence the author provided for the previous argument.

# Usages

## Reading/writing time allocation

### When you have to read _x_ number of books in _y_ amount of time. Typical use cases include

- literature review
- class reading assignments
- daily journal reading
- Ph.D comprehensive exam preparation.

## Explore effective methods of reading and writing

### When you want to become a better reader by trying different strategies, implemented as stages and items

- You can try different configuration of stages and time allocation.

<!-- # Personal history

I started writing my first timer of this nature a few months into my doctoral study. The coursework was intense. It's a humanities program which tends to assign more readings than most of other disciplines. On the heavier side, one course could assign two to three books every week; even the lighter courses would expect four to six readings at least for each session. And we take 3-5 courses each semester. So it averaged about  800 to 1,200 pages per week.

I know it's known fact in graduate school that there is the survival strategy which says you _don't_ read everything assigned but only those that can give you something to write and talk about for the next class. But I didn't believe in that, except for a few obligatory courses that I had to take as part of the degree requirements but was not interested in. For all the courses I picked myself, I, like any nerd in the graduate school, wanted to read _everything_ assigned and more (the person, the history, debate contexts, reviews etc). Of course, it was unrealistic to do all these with the limited time I had.

From this, I learned that (1) I absolutely need a timer to make sure I won't spend more time than I should reading one material, however much I enjoyed it, at the expanses of the others, and (2) I have to read smartly, which I didn't really know how to until after my comprehensive exam.

The first timer I built look like this: -->
